By producing\r\nTikZ, diagrams are typeset in native LaTeX and lines and shapes are drawn\r\nconsistently with other TikZ figures in a document. Further, more sophisticated\r\nannotations are possible by referencing parts of the wavefrom from custom TikZ\r\ncode.\r\n\r\nThis tool is currently in an incomplete and largely undocumented state. All\r\ndrawing of waveforms should be supported correctly but arrows and annotations\r\nare not.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nA simple example waveform.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  signal: [\r\n    { name : \"clk\",  wave : \"p....|..\" },\r\n    { name : \"data\", wave : \"x===.|.x\", data: \"a b c\" },\r\n    { name : \"vld\",  wave : \"01...|.0\" },\r\n    { name : \"rdy\",  wave : \"1..0.|1.\" },\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich can be built from within LaTeX source:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[thick]\r\n\t\\input{|\"wavedromtikz.py wavedrom figures/rdyvld-protocol.drom\"}\r\n\\end{tikzpicture}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProducing:\r\n\r\n![WaveDromTikZ example waveform](http://jhnet.co.uk/misc/waveDromTikZ.png)\r\n\r\nFor comparison, the original WaveDrom image:\r\n\r\n![Regular WaveDrom example waveform](http://jhnet.co.uk/misc/waveDrom.png)\r\n",
